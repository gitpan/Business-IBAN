Business::IBAN - Validate and generate IBANs

  use Business::IBAN;
  use Locale::Country;
  my $cc = country2code('Germany');
  my $iban = Business::IBAN->new();
  my $ib = $iban->getIBAN(
  {
    ISO => $cc, # or "DE", etc.
    BIC => 12345678, # Bank Identifier Code, meaning the BLZ
                     # in Germany
    AC => "1234567890",
  });
  # or
  my $ib = $iban->getIBAN(
  {
    ISO => "DE",
    BBAN => 123456781234567890,
  });
  if ($ib) {
    print "IBAN is $ib\n";
  }
  else {
    $iban->printError();
    # or
    my @errors = $iban->getError();
    # print your own error messages (for description of error-
    # codes see section ERROR-CODES
  }
  if ($iban->valid($ib)) {
    print "$iban is valid\n";
  }
  else {
    $iban->printError();
  }

With this module you can validate IBANs (International Bank
Account Number) like "IBAN DE97123456781234567890".
Note that this dos not (and cannot) assure that the bank
account exists or that the bank account number for the
bank itself is valid.
You can also create an IBAN if you supply

- your BBAN (Basic Bank Account Number),
  (or for germany your BLZ and account
  number are sufficient),

- and your country code (ISO3166)

It requires the module Locale::Country, which you can get
from www.cpan.org. It's a standard module since perl-version
5.7.2.

EXPORT

None by default. All methods are accessed over the object.

ERROR-CODES

You can print your own error-messages. The array you get from
  my @errors = $iban->getError();
are numbers which stand for the following errors:

	0: No Country or Iso-Code
	1: No BBAN (Bank-Number) or Bank Identifier and Accountnumber
	2: Could not find country
	3: IBAN must containt two-letter ISO-Code at the begining
	4: IBAN must only contain numbers after the ISO-code,
	5: IBAN is invalid

CAVEATS

Please note that this program is intended to validate IBANs and generate
them for you if you have your BBAN. It's not for generating valid
numbers for illegal purposes. The algorithm is simple and publicly
available for everyone. You can find informations about the IBAN at
